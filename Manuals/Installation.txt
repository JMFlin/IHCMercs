Installation:
Unzip into your macro's folder, this will add ihcinstall.mac and create a new folder named IHCMercs. The IHCMercs directory is where all your characters ini files will be created, there will also be a manuals folder giving an explanation of each classes ini setting and what they do.

Use:
*first time use* 
type /mac ihcinstall and wait for the pop up message.

Check the ini file and make any adjustments you might want to make, most have an out of the box config to preform their general role, ex: IHCENC is going to do full debuffing tash, slow, cripple, strip buffs...this might be a waste of time for your group or content, if mobs are dead before they are slowed or crippled...turn it off!
After the initial load and adjustments
 **target your main assist/tank
type /ihcstart on each char or all at once using bc....ex: /bcga //ihstart will start the mac on all supported classes.
*** Use the above command as written....NOT /mac ihcstart***

**Main assist must make sense, it is enforced by certain mac's....ex: the enchanter cant be MA because some of the roles like CC...if the ench is the MA and goes to CC a target everyone would jump on it!

*UPGRADE ONLY*
Backup then delete your old INI's
A lot of settings are the same, transfer them over, some have changed names or are new, please refer to the documentation.
